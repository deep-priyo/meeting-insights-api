##  Error Handling

The API provides comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes:

- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid input, file type, or size issues
- `401 Unauthorized` - Invalid or missing Gemini API key
- `429 Too Many Requests` - API quota exceeded or rate limiting
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Unexpected server errors
- `502 Bad Gateway` - AI service returned invalid response
- `504 Gateway Timeout` - AI service timeout

### Example Error Response:
```json
{
  "error": "File size too large. Maximum size is 10MB."
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key (required)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Alternative API key variable name
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment setting (development/production)

### Limits
- File size: 10MB maximum
- Text input: 50,000 characters maximum
- Supported formats: .txt files only
- AI model: gemini-2.5-flash

##  Key Differentiators

1. **Production-Ready Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with MVC pattern
2. **Comprehensive Validation**: Multi-layer input validation and sanitization
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Meaningful error messages with proper HTTP codes
4. **Flexible Input Methods**: Support for both file uploads and raw text
5. **AI Response Validation**: Validates and sanitizes AI responses before returning
6. **Security First**: File type validation, size limits, and secure middleware
7. **Configuration Management**: Environment-based setup for different deployments
